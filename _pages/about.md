Hi, this is Hao, currently a Research Assistant at Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University. I work in the **NeuroData Lab** led by Dr. Joshua Vogelstein, and conduct research related to biomedical data science and machine learning.

In spring 2021, I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with an MSE degree in *Biomedical Engineering*. Earlier than that, in spring 2020, I received a BS degree in *Bioengineering: Bioinformatics* from University of California, San Diego.
